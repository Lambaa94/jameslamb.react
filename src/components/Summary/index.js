                <p> Full stack web developer with a long history in Hospitality. I'm passionate about creating and inventing new, never thought about products. Excited to bring my passion into the workspace with my knowledge from the University of Pennsylvania's Coding Bootcamp. This is where I obtained my strong base for the MERN stack. Working my way through college and a conservatory taught me to keep my composure while under pressure. I am looking to be a part of a team to design and create web applications that will benefit the masses. The world is
                changing and advancing at a rapid pace, and it takes someone that is quick-witted and competent to get things done and done right.
