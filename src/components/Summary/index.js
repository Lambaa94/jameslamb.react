       <p> Full stack web developer with a long history in   Hospitality. Recently worked in a high
        intensity pre-theatre, fine dining restaurant dealing with large guest counts. I showed that
        I have exceptional time management skills combined with great organizational skills to keep
        my guests on time and comfortable. Being a head staff member, I would close the business on
        lucrative nights, keeping high-profile clients captivated and carefree. Passionate about
        creating and inventing new, never thought about products. Excited to bring my passion into
        the workspace with my newly found knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and React.js. I have a
        fondness for creating products that are pleasing to the eye and highly functional at the
        same time. Working my way through college and a conservatory taught me to keep my composure
        while under pressure. I am looking to be a part of a team to design and create web
        applications that will benefit the masses.
            <br />
            <br />
        On a more personal note, I have a big passion for food. Cooking and bringing people together
        with a great meal is one of my favourite things. I love the outdoors including camping,
        hiking, kayaking and snowbaording. From a young age, I have spent many sleepless nights
        playing video games. This sparked my interest in coding. I have always dreamed of being a
        part of a team that creates one of the things that has kept me endlessly entertained. With
        my knowledge that I have received from the University of Pennsylvania, I plan to rock the
        tech world and am very excited to begin my endeavour.

            <br />
        I've attended college at Rowan College at Burlington County in New Jersey where I studied
        for my first two years. I transitioned into my acting career in New York City at the
        American Muscial and Dramatic Academy. While training at this conservatory, I fell deeper in
        love with the restaurant scene and began to bartend for some of the best restaurants in New
        York City. I learned how to be a true team player and what it means to be a part of a
        well-oiled machine. Working in New York's restaurant scene, one acquires knowledge that is
        very hard to come by. It is a different animal when it comes to this stuff. New Yorkers take
        their food pretty seriously! My experience in this field has given me the resources to take
        what I know from the real world and apply it to our ever expanding web. The world is
        changing and advancing at a rapid pace, and it takes someone that is quick-witted and
        competent to get things done and done right.
