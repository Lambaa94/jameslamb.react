## Description
This application is my portfolio that I have created with *React*. With all of the knowledge I have gained from the University of Pennsylvania I was able to progress as a developer. I have included various bits of information on the application along with projects and personal assignments that I have worked on and still working on. I took my original portfolio page that I created at the begginning of the program and updated it to be a sleek one page design with *React*.
